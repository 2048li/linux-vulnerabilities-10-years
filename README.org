#+TITLE: A Decade of Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities, their Mitigation and Open Problems

This repository contains source for my Master's Thesis on different types of
Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities that exist today. It consists of a survey of ~10
years of Linux Kernel CVEs (2007-2016), divides them into various broad
categories of Vulnerabilities and includes existing mitigation for them.

While the mitigation aren't exhaustive, they are sampled from both Research
Literature and industry i.e. existing code in Linux Kernel, out-of-tree patches
etc. It also includes various tools that can be used to analyze and detect
various kind of Vulnerabilities.


* How to read this content?

The entire thesis is divided into 5 chapters, first 3 of which are related to
Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities. 4th chapter talks about Return Oriented
Programming attacks. 5th Chapter concludes with what classes of vulnerabilities
do and don't have any pro-active solution for them.

You can browse [[thesis.org][a copy in the repository]] or have a look at the [[thesis.pdf][PDF]]. PDF has
slightly better formatting and comes with complete references.
